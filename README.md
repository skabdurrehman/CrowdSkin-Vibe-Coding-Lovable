# üå≥ CrowdSkin - Your Inner Forest Companion

*A self-perception reflection app that gently grows a tree from your emotions*

## üå± What is CrowdSkin?

CrowdSkin is an innovative emotional wellness application that transforms your daily feelings into a living, breathing digital tree. Unlike abstract visualizations or random clustering, CrowdSkin creates a botanically truthful and psychologically grounded representation of your emotional journey.

Every interaction creates a new emotion-leaf, born from your self-described color, shape, and emotional tone. The innovation lies in our advanced growth logic: all leaves grow only in the natural canopy area, never covering the trunk or floating awkwardly below, creating a realistic tree that grows upward just like nature intended.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üçÉ Intelligent Leaf Placement System
- **Smart Canopy Logic**: Newer leaves appear at the growing edge of the canopy
- **Emotional Clustering**: Similar moods cluster into color groups (anger reds on left, calm blues toward top)
- **Dynamic Expansion**: When canopy becomes dense, tree expands width rather than height
- **Physics-Based Branches**: Branches adapt length and curvature based on total leaf count

### üé® Daily Reflection Interface
The app asks three profound questions:
1. *"If your body felt like a shape today, what would it be?"*
2. *"If today had a color, what would it be?"*
3. *"If your presence had a direction, what would it be ‚Äî reaching outward, curling inward, still, rising?"*

From these responses, a uniquely shaped and colored leaf is created with exact stylization based on your inputs (triangular, oval, wavy, jagged, light, dark, etc.).

### üå≤ Interactive Tree Experience
- **Touch-Responsive**: Tap any leaf to zoom in and replay its emotion
- **Private Notes**: Hold a leaf to view that day's reflection in a soothing overlay
- **Smooth Navigation**: Scroll vertically or pinch to view the full canopy
- **Clean Architecture**: Trunk and roots remain untouched, representing your unchanging core self

### üåü Seasonal Milestones & Rewards
- **30 leaves**: New branch grows
- **50 leaves**: Gentle wind animation, birds visit the canopy
- **100 leaves**: Healing blossoms appear
- **150+ leaves**: Twilight mode unlocks with glowing nightlight background

### üîÑ Additional Modes

#### ü™û Mirror Companion
Gentle support when facing your reflection feels difficult, providing compassionate guidance during challenging emotional moments.

#### üåä Release Space (Dump Zone)
A safe space to let go of heavy thoughts and watch them transform, helping process difficult emotions constructively.

#### üå± Roots Mode
Allows users to bury heavy thoughts as root seeds, unseen in the canopy yet feeding the emotional soil. Roots grow downward, symbolically anchoring the tree and showing that healing is invisible but powerful.

#### üí≠ Mood Check-in
Quick emotional temperature checks that create colored indicators on your tree, perfect for busy days when full reflection isn't possible.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom sage, lavender, and beige color palette
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and transforms for smooth interactions
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Key Components
- `AnimatedTree.tsx`: Core tree visualization with physics-based growth
- `DailyReflection.tsx`: Reflection input interface with smooth transitions
- `useTreeGrowth.ts`: Custom hook managing tree state and growth logic
- `WelcomeOverlay.tsx`: Onboarding experience explaining the app's philosophy

### Smart Growth Algorithm
```typescript
// Intelligent leaf placement considering:
// - Canopy boundaries and natural tree architecture
// - Emotional clustering for visual coherence
// - Branch weight distribution and physics
// - Seasonal growth patterns and milestones
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
- **Sage Green**: Primary color representing growth and tranquility
- **Soft Beige**: Warm, grounding earth tones
- **Gentle Lavender**: Calming accent for emotional moments
- **Organic Shapes**: Rounded corners and natural curves throughout
